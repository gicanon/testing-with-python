# Secure Software Development

These activities are to be carried out in line with the content of Unit 4 of the SSD moudule (in Cyber Security).  

Step through the Guide (Tools -> Guide-> Play) to access the activities.  The instructions are also provided on the learning platform.

Run your code using `python3 [filename].py` (or use the **rocket icon**) 

## 1. Introduction
### Secure Software Development
**Remember to save your work to your GitHub Repository**

Unit Topic: Linters

These are the Python programs that will support your practical work this Unit and can be seen in the filetree:
- metricTest.py
- pylintTest.py
- styleLint.py
- sums.py
- sums2.py

Run your code using `python3 [filename].py` (or use the **rocket icon**)

## 2. Testing with Python
### Exploring Linters to Support Testing in Python: Question 1
Run `styleLint.py`.

- What happens when the code is run?
- Can you modify this code for a more favourable outcome?
- What amendments have you made to the code?

## 3. Testing with Python
### Exploring Linters to Support Testing in Python: Question 2 Ensure pylint is in your virtual box -
> ✅ pip install pylint

Run pylint on `pylintTest.py`

- Review each of the code errors returned.
- Can you correct each of the errors identified by pylint? Before correcting the code errors, save the `pylintTest.py` file with a new name (it will be needed again in the next question).


## 4. Testing with Python
### Exploring Linters to Support Testing in Python: Question 3 Ensure flake8 is in your virtual box -
> ✅ pip install flake8

Run flake8 on `pylintTest.py`

- Review the errors returned. In what way does this error message differ from the error message returned by pylint?

Run flake8 on `metricTest.py.`

- Can you correct each of the errors returned by flake8?
- What amendments have you made to the code?

## 5. Testing with Python
### Exploring Linters to Support Testing in Python: Question 4 Ensure mccabe is in your virtual box -
> ✅ pip install mccabe

Run mccabe on `sums.py.` What is the result?<br>

Run mccabe on `sums2.py.` What is the result?

- What are the contributors to the cyclomatic complexity in each piece of code?
